#### NECESSARY DATA
- Name of the comic<br />
  ***\<name in Daily Comics\>***

  ***\<URL\>***
- An idea for a RegEx (regular expression), containing a sub-expression which exactly matches the image URL to be extracted from the content of the source page.<br />
  ***`<RegEx>`***
- If such a single RegEx is not feasible, please design a JavaScript code snippet, which extracts the URL of the image of the most recent comic strip starting from the content retrieved via the URL provided in the second bullet point of this section "NECESSARY DATA".
