**Daily Comics VERSION** (Daily Comics â†’ [Top pulley] About): ***`<x.y.z>`***
<br />

#### REQUIRED METADATA
- Name of the strip<br />
  ***\<official, full name\>***
- Author(s)<br />
  ***\<real name(s), if available, and pseudonym(s) / nickname(s)\>***
- Home webpage<br />
  ***\<URL to official webpage\>***
- Existing strip, which is very typical for this comic strip
  (shouid include the main character(s) of this strip)<br />
  ***\<URL or image file\>***
- Easily recognisable logo, icon or picture for the cover page of this
  strip (might include the main character(s) of this strip)<br />
  ***\<URL or image file\>***

See **[this document] ()** for details on these requirements, the image resolutions stated there are the minimal ones: Images can be easily downscaled, but up-scaling always involves a significant loss of visual quality.

#### NECESSARY DATA
These are technically necessary to implement a new strip source in Daily Comic.
- Webpage, whose HTML source code enables extracting an URL to a single image of the newest, published strip.  This page can be identical to the home-page of the strip, which is provided in the prior paragraph.<br />
  ***\<URL\>***
- An idea for a RegEx (regular expression) to do so<br />
  ***`<RegEx>`***
- If such a single RegEx is not feasible, you can provide a JavaCript code snippet, which extracts the URL to the image of the current comic strip.
  ```
  <JavaScript code>
  ```

Also providing this necessary data lowers the time and effort it takes to implement a new strip significantly.  Or provide a pull request (PR) for this new comic strip, after having read **[this guidance] ()**.
